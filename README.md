# CAN using STM32's CAN peripheral

## Setup

This code is written for use with the STM32 'Bluepill' development board and the Microchip MCP2562 CANBUS transceiver. The wiring is to be set up as shown below:

## Usage

The CANBUS network is configured to use a 500k Baud rate, and the UART output for debugging is set up to be running at 115200 bits/s.
